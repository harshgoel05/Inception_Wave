    Time came and everyone of us knew we had to choose our direction .Right from the end of boards everyone had only one thought on mind What college will they get? Results came and people had different reactions. Now it was the time to board our respective flight .Everyone was departing with a smile on face and watery eyes; taking a lot of memories along with them. The ones who hardly interacted also joined the scene. Despite all the grief and sadness everyone was excited as they were to embark on a new journey of meeting new people and have new adventures.
    <br>
    Among them was someone who was going relatively too far. He was excited as his wish was to come true but at the same time the feeling to leave his friends and was killing him from inside; dilemma without solution. The ship was stuck in storm and the sailor was all alone .He had to save his life but was clueless on where the shore was or in which direction to go so he decided to go with the flow.’
    <br>
    Now what did the phrase “go with the flow” in this case meant? In last days before his departure he just wanted to make memories. Everyone was informed and scene was set for action. The ‘Soul mate was told exactly how the shot were to be taken. He was doing all he could to make it perfect .Being with him throughout without any excuses, without any complaints, tolerating all the rude behavior and giving the phrase “one call away” a meaning. Just like a movie too many perfect shots were demanded with many characters that were to play an important role as each one was important and each role had its own significance.
    <br>
    Everything was going perfect and then arrived the day, A day to remember  14th July 2016 because next day itself he were to board flight to an entirely new world; climax to the movie. Preparations were done to make the best out of it. All the important people gathered before a final good-bye just to make the good-bye a special one.
    <br>
     AND YES, AS THE TEAM COMPRISED OF ALL SPECIAL PEOPLE i.e., THE STARCAST OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE THE GOODBYE WAS A SPECIAL ONE TOO. All the good-byes and see offs done and he was left with three people ,people closest to his heart ,people whom he never wanted to bid goodbye to ,people for whom the words always fell short ,people who were life; and all three goons standing there with a big smile, hiding away tears.
     <br>
    And then the moment came when he finally, though unwillingly had to say good-bye, the next meeting was sure but good bye was the hardest one. As soon as these people were leaving he gave a hard handshake but then there was this person that Soul Mate who said in a very low voice holding his tears “bhai mujhse b bas haath hi milaega.. gale lag ja harami.“He hugged him; hug which gave them strength .And eventually hugged everyone and they all left.
    <br>
    As he saw them walking away he wanted to shout STOP! Guys please dont leave but he wasnt able to, holding back his tears for his parents were waiting inside, who cared even more and would have fallen weak on seeing him cry. So he held the tears in his eyes and left a text to someone special “Bhai teri bhot yaad aaegi..” and he left for dinner, he was about to begin and his phone rang .NOW WHAT? And it was call from the person he texted and the person on other side just said “aise message dobara na aa jaae.”And hearing this he smiled and was like “OK“. The things didn’t stop with “OK” they actually began. None of them was able to eat that night. They just kept texting each other whole night. These texts cherished all the memories. Memories that had lots of emotion attached to them; as he cried .The person had to leave at 4:00 am next morning but wasn’t willing to sleep as he didn’t want to leave the other one. But eventually he got a green signal around 2:00 am and he finally slept. The other one was clever enough to provide the green signal as he wanted to say something but in absence of the other. He read the texts next morning faked a smile, got ready and left the place he had been for 17 odd years. He had a mixed feeling to leave the place but was fine as he had his parents and a lovely little sister along with him. They reached the airport and boarded the flight.
    <br>
    Sitting in plane he went numb of emotions, thoughts right then were unexplainable. Only 2 hours 50 minutes of flight that covered distance of about 2100 km, from 200,300 meters to 2100 km. As he landed he found himself on another part of country, with an entirely different culture.
    <br>
    In course of two days all the formalities were completed, he spend his two precious days with parents until next time .Warm hug from parents and his sister to bid goodbye and off coarse few words of wisdom. And as soon as they left he found himself alone in the room and soon realized the changes he needed to accept.
    <br>
    Yes off course social media connects them but he still misses everyone, everything and everyday. Technology can help them stay connected but it can’t bring them together like before. Yes, emotions and bond they share won’t weaken but these ‘buts and ifs‘ would remain with him.
    <br>
    First scene of movie was perfectly shot and captured, and then these beautiful lines flash through his mind “We keep this love in a photograph we made these memories for ourselves“.        
    <br>
     And all he could say is “I really miss you, even the strangers who seemed to be friends.”
     <br>
    That might have been the end of one chapter but new chapter waits to be written.</p>
